# blazor-people-app
Small Blazor test app for fetching and adding person objects to a DB using EF Core

You will need to run "Update-database" or "Script-migration" from the Package Manager Console to create your own People table in your SQL localdb.
Change connectionString in appsettings.json if needed.
Then use the people page "/people" to view the table and add more people.
